# Project Title
### Automated Face Bluring

<br>Author : A Sai Sankeerth</br>
<br>Domain : AI Project</br>

# Description
This project proposes developing a real-time facial blurring system with OpenCV and Python. Using computer vision techniques, the system accurately detects faces in video streams or photos and applies real-time blurring using efficient algorithms. The system ensures smooth operation and easy parameter change by optimising for speed and designing a user-friendly interface. Rigorous testing and validation ensure that the system performs well in a variety of settings, making it a useful solution for protecting privacy in digital content.
